1st method
Sean maize bran = 300/ per kg Kamanyire orders a supply of  200kg 
Carter fish = 250/ per kg Kamanyire orders a supply 500kg 

kamanyire determines the sales price of each unit once the supplies have reached his business premises
maize bran at 350/ per kilo
Fish 290/ per kilo

Kamanyire decides to mix a sack of 134kgs which layer's marsh but he goes ahead to compute the cost of 134kgs of layer's marsh product 
Layers_marsh 100 kg of bran 34 kgs of fish
(maize_brn)100kg * 300 = 30000/
(fish)34kg * 250 = 8500/ 
Total 38500/
 
Selling 
Each of kilo of maizebran = 350 * 100kg = 35000
Each kilo of fish  = 290 * 34kg = 9860
total = 44860

Profit 44860 - 38500 = 6360

2nd method
Sean maize bran = 300/ per kg Kamanyire orders a supply of  200kg 
Carter fish = 250/ per kg Kamanyire orders a supply 500kg 

Kamanyire decides to mix a sack of 134kgs which layer's marsh but he goes ahead to compute the cost of 134kgs of layer's marsh product 
Layers_marsh 100 kg of bran 34 kgs of fish
(maize_brn)100kg * 300 = 30000/
(fish)34kg * 250 = 8500/ 
Total 38500/

Kamanyire will want to compute at how much he will sell the sack
134kg = 38500
1kg = 38500 / 134
1kg = 287.3

Kamanyire sets his own price of one kilo
1kg = 1200
134kg = 1200 * 134
134kg = 160800

Profit = 160800 - 38500
Profit = 122300

Am thinking of also having a table of mixtures that has different mixture codes and those codes have id
such that when someone is mixing , i will program the computer that it must request for input of a number of certain kgs of specific raw materials 
which will be subtracted from the raw materials table.

Now am also thinking that we can create a raw_material sales table because Mr kamanyire also said that he sells the raw materials sometimes , so what i would think is this . Create another sales table to represent the sales of raw materials . The attributes include the id , quantity , raw_material_name , profit , unit_price , amount .

Business Process desi 
The supply story goes like this .
Kamanyire calls his different suppliers to ask about a price about a particular raw materials . Then he gets to know the lowest unit price . 
Once he knows that , he orders for the specified number of kilograms to be supplied.
Then that raw material is brought to his shop.
Once the raw materials are brought , he then registers the transaction inside his book .
He records , Date , raw_material , supplier , quantity , unitprice , total amount .
